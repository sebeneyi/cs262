in markers.js

deleted unused import StyleSheet, Text, Dimensions, Modal, Image, Component

did not delete unused variable text, because although it said unused, it is just always being updated

in app.js

said 'require' was undefined, but you do not need to define function 'require' for it to be used. (also otherwise we cannot use different fonts)
